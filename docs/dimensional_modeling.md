# Dimensional Modeling

> Dimensional modeling is a design approach optimized for analytic systems. A dimensional model captures how a process is measured. Data elements that represent measurements are called facts. Data elements that provide context for measurements are called dimensions. These elements are grouped into dimension tables and fact tables. Implemented in a relational database, the design is called a star schema.
