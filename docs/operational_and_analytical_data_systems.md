# Operational and analytical data systems

Simply put, operational data is the data created by the school district's day-to-day operations. The student information system is an example of an operational data system. An operational database is designed to support a high volume of transaction processing where records are frequently being created, updated, and deleted. These systems are also referred to as Online Transaction Processing systems, or OLTP systems.
