# Operational and analytical data systems

> Analytic systems and operational systems serve fundamentally different purposes. An operational system supports the *execution* of a business process, while an analytic system supports the *evaluation* of the process.

Simply put, operational data is the data created by the school district's day-to-day operations. The student information system is an example of an operational data system. An operational system is designed to support a high volume of transaction processing by which records are frequently being created, updated, and deleted. These systems are also referred to as Online Transaction Processing systems, or OLTP systems.

As seen in the image below, the Ed-Fi Operational Data Store (ODS) is an additional layer of operational data before the analytical layer. K12 data systems are structured this way because of what the nature of an Ed-Fi integration is. When an edTech vendor provides an Ed-Fi integration, they take responsibility for managing a set of data on a target Ed-Fi API. This means the **vendor** will send data back to you and keep it up-to-date as it changes in their system. This additional operational data layer is also where the Ed-Fi Data Standard comes in. Naturally, operational data is modeled differently in each edTech platform. When each vendor maps their data to the Ed-Fi Data Standard, they are deciding how to represent their information via the Ed-Fi Unifying Data Model. That step allows for that data to become interoperable between systems and eases the downstream analytical data modeling.

The Ed-Fi ODS is a highly normalized, row-based database designed to support the functions required by an operational store. Thus it is not a good candidate for analytics work. While an operational data system is used in a more tactical, record events from the day-to-day operations of a school district, an analytical data system is used to make strategic decisions that improve teaching and learning. The queries run on analytical data systems look very different as data needs to be aggregated far more and analysis needs to be performed on the data (vs data retrieval and updating that is done on operational data). This type of system is also called an Online Analytical Processing system, or OLAP system.

Analytical data systems typically take the form of a cloud data warehouse such as Google BigQuery, AWS Redshift, or Snowflake. These cloud data warehouses are columnar databases meaning they store data in such as way where columns of data are stored together on disk whereas row-based operational database products store rows of data together. This difference is an important one. Row-based storage is essential for an operational store since whole rows of data are typically created, updated and deleted. Column-based storage is essential for an analytical store due to SQL queries often aggregating (ie. `AVG() or MAX()`) data across all rows.
