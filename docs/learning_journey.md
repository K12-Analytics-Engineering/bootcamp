# Learning Journey

Said best by [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/what-is-analytics-engineering), "*An Analytics Engineer spends their time transforming, testing, deploying, and documenting data.

The resources found in this GitHub organization serve to empower Analytics Engineers in their work with K12 education data. The pathway laid out below explains in a very direct way, what a person needs to understand, learn, and do to build a full analytics stack for their education organization.


### Accounts

All resources will live in a Google Cloud project. Create a Google Cloud account with an active billing account. If prompted, activate your $300 credit.

Create an Ed-Fi Community account. This will give you access to Ed-Fi documentation (TechDocs), ticketing system (Ed-Fi Tracker), and the Ed-Fi Slack. Join the #k12-analytics-engineering Slack channel and say 'Hello!'
